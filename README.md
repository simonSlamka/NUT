# NUT - the Neural Understanding Training
> [!NOTE] Just a simple training repo for neural nets and some basic linear algebra/calculus

Gonna reimplement some stuff from scratch, just for fun and to get a better understanding of the math behind it, esp. a singular neuron, different layers, fwd prop, backprop, losses, activations, optimizers, etc.
